## Overview üåê
The **Media Service** is a crucial component of the **CodeAdvisors** platform, designed to handle media file management, including file uploads, retrieval, and deletion. It supports handling multiple file uploads at once and provides a way to preview images, stream content, and manage file storage.

The service interacts with **MinIO** for file storage and uses **PostgreSQL** for persisting metadata.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Spring Boot**: Microservice framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MinIO**: Object storage service for storing files.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing metadata.
- **JPA**: For handling relational data persistence.
- **Eureka**: Service discovery for seamless microservice interaction.
- **Config**: Centralized configuration management.
